If you want additional information on the features in the data, please
visit here: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Urban+Land+Cover
(Links to an external site.)

Please note, the link above has datasets labeled backwards from the
assignment data. But, it does include information on each feature.

For assignment \#5 we will be working with UCI's Urban Land Cover Data
Set. This is the classification of urban land cover with 9 different
classes that are fairly balanced across train \& test. Multi-scale
spectral, size, shape, and texture information are used for
classification.

You will need to use the SVC \& LinearSVC classifiers from sklearn.svm.
You will also need to use RandomForestClassifier (from HW \#4) to
compare performance of this model to support vector machine models.

    The overall accuracy for training set is 0.99, but the overall accuracy
score for testing set is only 0.82 for Random Forest Classifier. By
looking at the classification report, this model is over-fitting since
all the prediction accuracy scores including ``precision, recall, and
f1-score'' of training sets are much more than the prediction accuracy
scores of testing sets. This means this model will be very good training
data, but it doesn't fit the new comming in data well.

    The overall accuracy for the training set is 0.99, but the overall
testing set accuracy is only 0.74 for LinearSVM. By looking at the
classification report, this model is very over-fitting since all the
prediction accuracy scores including ``precision, recall, and f1-score''
of training sets are much higher than the prediction accuracy scores of
testing sets. The difference between training set RMSE and testing set
RMSE is getting larger compared with random forest classifier model.
This means the linearSVC model will be very good for training set data,
but it doesn't fit the new comming data well.

    The training set accuracy is 0.89, but the testing set accuracy is 0.80
by applying GridSearch to find the most appropriate model for kernel =
`linear'. By looking at the classification report, this model is a
little bit over-fitting since most of the prediction accuracy scores
including ``precision, recall, and f1-score'' of training sets are a
little more than the prediction accuracy scores of testing sets.
However, the difference between training set RMSE and testing set RMSE
for this best\_svc model is less than the differences of Random Forest
classifier and LinearSVC of default parameters. This model has been
improved hugely for the overall prediciton accuracies. This model is
still a little bit over-fitting but much better than previous models.

    The training set accuracy is 0.97, but the testing set accuracy is only
0.76 by applying GridSearch to find the most appropriate model for
kernel = `poly'. By looking at the classification report, this model is
very over-fitting since most of the prediction accuracy scores including
``precision, recall, and f1-score'' of training sets are much higher
than the prediction accuracy scores of testing sets. This model doesn't
fit the new coming data set well.

    The training set accuracy is 0.99, but the testing set accuracy is only
0.83 by applying GridSearch to find the most appropriate model for
kernel = `rbf'. By looking at the classification report, this model is
very over-fitting since most of the prediction accuracy scores for each
class including ``precision, recall, and f1-score'' of training sets are
much higher than the prediction accuracy scores of testing sets. There
is a huge difference between the training set RMSE and testing set RMSE.
This model doesn't fit the new coming data set well.

  According to the testing set accuracy score, the rbf model from
  question 6 gives the highest. This model has an accuracy score of
  0.83. The random forest has the accuracy score of 0.82 for testing
  set. However, both of these two models are very over-fitting. I cannot
  say that if this model will work well while new data coming into this
  model. These two models may not be stable especially for random forest
  classifier. However, for the model from question 4 to use GridSearch
  to find the most appropriate model for kernel = `linear', the RMSE
  differences between training and testing sets is the smallest. This
  model is the least over-fitting model. This model could give a
  reasonable prediction for testing set.
\end{enumerate}

In conclusion, according to overall accuracies, since both training set
and testing set accuracies are higher for the `rbf' kernnel model from
question 6. The `rbf' model in question 6 gives the best performances
for predictions.

  A linear kernel can be used as normal dot product any two given
  observations. The product between two vectors is the sum of the
  multiplication of each pair of input values. A polynomial kernel is a
  more generalized form of the linear kernel. The polynomial kernel can
  distinguish curved or nonlinear input space. The Radial basis function
  kernel is a popular kernel function commonly used in support vector
  machine classification. RBF can map an input space in infinite
  dimensional space.
\end{enumerate}

linear: z=y\emph{x+b\\
polynominal: z=(y}x+b)\^{}2\\
rbf: z = exp(-γ\textbar{}\textbar{}χ-y \textbar{}\textbar{}2)

Why rbf and polynomial outperform linear?

The squared exponential kernel(rbf) defines a function space that is a
lot larger than that of the linear kernel or the polynomial kernel. A
linear kernel uses linear functions, which are really impoverished. As
the increase of the order of the polynomial kernel, the size of the
function class increases. An n-th order polynomial kernel gives all the
analytic functions whose derivatives of order (n+1) are constant, and
hence all derivatives of and above order (n+2) are zero. The squared
exponential kernel provides access to all analytic functions (that is
all infinitely differentiable functions). So in some sense, I could view
the SE kernel as being as powerful as an infinite order polynomial
kernel (this is technically incorrect, but a useful way to start
understanding the differences). If I use squared exponential kernel,
than this method is nonparametric, but if I use polynomial kernels, this
model will be parametric. If I test it more and more data, it will be
able to represent more and more complex relationships. In contrast a
parametric model's size is fixed, so after a certain point, my model
will be saturated, and giving it more and more data won't help. So
asymptotically, assuming it have unlimited data and very weak
assumptions about the problem, a nonparametric method is always better.

In conclusion, the squared exponential kernel is generally more flexible
than the linear or polynomial kernels in that I can model a whole lot
more functions with its function space. However, it is reasonable to
assume what the true function can be well approximated by a linear,
polynomial, or rbf function. Compared with polynomial and rbf, it will
fit for the polynomial model if I have a lot less data then the squared
exponential.

Downsides for `poly':\\
Polynomial regression and regression based on the ``kernel trick'', for
instance, are both examples of parametric techniques. It means that I
will be fitting either a particular function or functional form, which
if my data is not a good fit for that particular form, then I will not
get good predictions.

Downsides for `rbf':\\
When a model has been trained based on the RBF (Gaussian) kernel, I need
to store the entire training dataset to compute similarity features.
This may decrease the efficiency of RBF SVMs, since I will have my data
to ``carry around'' on top of the weights. There are some ways of
mitigating this such as the surprise criterion, basically I only keep a
training point if it changes my model significantly.

  C is a regularization parameter that controls the trade off between
  the achieving a low training error and a low testing error that is the
  ability to generalize my classifier to unseen data. The C parameter
  tells the SVM optimization how much I want to avoid misclassifying
  each training example. For large values of C, the optimization will
  choose a smaller-margin hyperplane if that hyperplane does a better
  job of getting all the training points classified correctly.
  Conversely, a very small value of C will cause the optimizer to look
  for a larger-margin separating hyperplane, even if that hyperplane
  misclassifies more points. For very tiny values of C, I should get
  misclassified examples, often even if my training data is linearly
  separable. Consider the objective function of a linear SVM : min
  \textbar{}w\textbar{}\^{}2+C∑ξ

  SVMs assume that the data it works with is in a standard range,
  usually either 0 to 1, or -1 to 1 (roughly). So the normalization of
  feature vectors prior to feeding them to the SVM is very important.
  (This is often called whitening, although there are different types of
  whitening.) To make sure that for each dimension, the values are
  scaled to lie roughly within this range. SVM tries to maximize the
  distance between the separating plane and the support vectors. If one
  feature (i.e.~one dimension in this space) has very large values, it
  will dominate the other features when calculating the distance. If I
  rescale all features (e.g.~to {[}0, 1{]}), they all have the same
  influence on the distance metric.
\end{enumerate}

Otherwise if we don't scale the data, e.g.~dimension 1 is from 0-1000
and dimension 2 is from 0-1.2, then dimension 1 becomes much more
important than dimension 2, which will skew results.

\item
  SVM algorithms use a set of mathematical functions that are defined as
  the kernel. The function of kernel is to take data as input and
  transform it into the required form. Different SVM algorithms use
  different types of kernel functions. These functions can be different
  types. For example linear, nonlinear, polynomial, radial basis
  function (RBF), and sigmoid. Introduce Kernel functions for sequence
  data, graphs, text, images, as well as vectors. The most used type of
  kernel function is RBF. Because it has localized and finite response
  along the entire x-axis.
\end{enumerate}

The kernel functions return the inner product between two points in a
suitable feature space. Thus by defining a notion of similarity, with
little computational cost even in very high-dimensional spaces. Kernel
function reduces the complexity of finding the mapping function.
Therefore, Kernel function defines inner product in the transformed
space. I have used Radial Basis Function kernel to plot figure 2, where
mapping from 2D space to 3D space indeed helps us in classification.

    some notes for this assignment: The SVM algorithm is implemented in
practice using a kernel. A kernel transforms an input data space into
the required form. The kernel takes a low-dimensional input space and
transforms it into a higher dimensional space. It means that it converts
nonseparable problem to separable problems by adding more dimension to
it. It is most useful in non-linear separation problem. Kernel trick
helps to build a more accurate classifier.

Technically if I use squared exponential kernel, than this method is
nonparametric, but if I use polynomial kernels, this model will be
parametric. In a way nonparametric model means that the complexity of
the model is potentially infinite, it's complexity can grow with the
data. If I test it more and more data, it will be able to represent more
and more complex relationships. In contrast a parametric model's size is
fixed, so after a certain point, my model will be saturated, and giving
it more and more data won't help. So asymptotically, assuming it have
unlimited data and very weak assumptions about the problem, a
nonparametric method is always better.
