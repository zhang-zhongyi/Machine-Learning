The difference between training set RMSE and testing set RMSE is getting larger compared with random forest classifier model.

By looking at the classification report, this model is a little bit over-fitting since most of the prediction accuracy scores including “precision, recall, and f1-score” of training sets are a little more than the prediction accuracy scores of testing sets. However, the difference between training set RMSE and testing set RMSE for this best_svc model is less than the differences of Random Forest classifier and LinearSVC of default parameters. This model has been improved hugely for the overall prediciton accuracies. This model is still a little bit over-fitting but much better than previous models."

    "a) According to the testing set accuracy score, the rbf model from question 6 gives the highest. This model has an accuracy score of 0.83. The random forest has the accuracy score of 0.82 for testing set. However, both of these two models are very over-fitting. I cannot say that if this model will work well while new data coming into this model. These two models may not be stable especially for random forest classifier. However, for the model from question 4 to use GridSearch to find the most appropriate model for kernel = 'linear', the RMSE differences between training and testing sets is the smallest. This model is the least over-fitting model. This model could give a reasonable prediction for testing set. \n",

    "b) A linear kernel can be used as normal dot product any two given observations. The product between two vectors is the sum of the multiplication of each pair of input values. A polynomial kernel is a more generalized form of the linear kernel. The polynomial kernel can distinguish curved or nonlinear input space. The Radial basis function kernel is a popular kernel function commonly used in support vector machine classification. RBF can map an input space in infinite dimensional space.         \n",

    "The squared exponential kernel(rbf) defines a function space that is a lot larger than that of the linear kernel or the polynomial kernel. A linear kernel uses linear functions, which are really impoverished. As the increase of the order of the polynomial kernel, the size of the function class increases. An n-th order polynomial kernel gives all the analytic functions whose derivatives of order (n+1) are constant, and hence all derivatives of and above order (n+2) are zero. The squared exponential kernel provides access to all analytic functions (that is all infinitely differentiable functions). So in some sense, I could view the SE kernel as being as powerful as an infinite order polynomial kernel (this is technically incorrect, but a useful way to start understanding the differences). If I use squared exponential kernel, than this method is nonparametric, but if I use polynomial kernels, this model will be parametric. If I test it more and more data, it will be able to represent more and more complex relationships. In contrast a parametric model's size is fixed, so after a certain point, my model will be saturated, and giving it more and more data won't help. So asymptotically, assuming it have unlimited data and very weak assumptions about the problem, a nonparametric method is always better.\n",

    "c) C is a regularization parameter that controls the trade off between the achieving a low training error and a low testing error that is the ability to generalize my classifier to unseen data. The C parameter tells the SVM optimization how much I want to avoid misclassifying each training example. For large values of C, the optimization will choose a smaller-margin hyperplane if that hyperplane does a better job of getting all the training points classified correctly. Conversely, a very small value of C will cause the optimizer to look for a larger-margin separating hyperplane, even if that hyperplane misclassifies more points. For very tiny values of C, I should get misclassified examples, often even if my training data is linearly separable. Consider the objective function of a linear SVM : min |w|^2+C∑ξ"

    "d) SVMs assume that the data it works with is in a standard range, usually either 0 to 1, or -1 to 1 (roughly). So the normalization of feature vectors prior to feeding them to the SVM is very important. (This is often called whitening, although there are different types of whitening.)  To make sure that for each dimension, the values are scaled to lie roughly within this range. SVM tries to maximize the distance between the separating plane and the support vectors. If one feature (i.e. one dimension in this space) has very large values, it will dominate the other features when calculating the distance. If I rescale all features (e.g. to [0, 1]), they all have the same influence on the distance metric.\n",

Introduce Kernel functions for sequence data, graphs, text, images, as well as vectors. The most used type of kernel function is RBF.

The kernel takes a low-dimensional input space and transforms it into a higher dimensional space. It means that it converts nonseparable problem to separable problems by adding more dimension to it. It is most useful in non-linear separation problem. Kernel trick helps to build a more accurate classifier.\n",
